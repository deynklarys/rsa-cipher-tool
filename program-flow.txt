1) ----------------------------------------------------------

1.0) show confirmation text to user
    Screen output
        You are about to generate an RSA private key with this option. Additionally, it will display the public key of a generated private key. Do you agree to save a copy of your private and public keys? [Y/N]
1.1) show loading bars and generate keys
    Screen output
        Save a copy of your private key and public key.
1.2) output private and pubic key
    Screen output
        Private Key:
        Public Key:
        Enter DONE to back:    
1.3) loop back to HOME


2) ----------------------------------------------------------


2.0) show confirmation text to user
    Screen output
        Encryption includes the message to be encrypted and the public key of the recipient. The txt file of the message must be in the same folder of the C program. Is the txt file in the same folder of the C program? [Y/N] 
        Do you have the public key of the recipient? [Y/N]
2.1) get txt file
    Screen output
        Enter the file name: //This is still unsure.        
2.2) get keys 
    Screen output
        Enter recipient's public key: 
2.3) show loading bars and encrypt txt file
    Screen output
        (under loading bar) Encrypting message...
2.4) output encrypted file
2.5) print results. E.g: "encrypted 1234 charactes in 30.2 secs"
    Screen output
        Process complete!
        Encrypted 1234 chracters in __ seconds
        Enter DONE to back:
2.6) loop back to HOME

3.0) show confirmation text to user
    Screen output
        Encryption includes the message to be encrypted and the public key of the recipient. The txt file of the message must be in the same folder of the C program. Is the txt file in the same folder of the C program? [Y/N] 
        Do you have the public key of the recipient? [Y/N]
3.1) get txt file
    Screen output
        Enter the file name: //This is still unsure. 
3.2) get keys
    Screen output
        Enter your private key: 
3.3) show loading bars and decrypt txt file
    Screen output
        (under loading bar) Decrypting message...
3.4) output decrypted file
3.5) print results. E.g: "decrypted 1234 characters in 30.2 secs"
    Screen output
        Process complete!
        Decrypted 1234 chracters in __ seconds 
        Enter DONE to back:

        RSA Cipher Tool with Custom Bignum Library

        The RSA Cipher Tool program generates, encrypts, and decrypts messages using the RSA algorithm. The program uses the RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) Algorithm to generate public and private keys needed to encrypt and decrypt messages and a custom bignum library to handle large numbers.

        The user will use the program to encrypt a message in a file, where it will then return the encrypted/secret message. Then, they can now send it to the recipient of the message safely, where they can also use the same program to decrypt the message and reveal the actual message.

        This is a programming project for Computer Programming 2 during the Academic Year 2023-2024 at the Bicol University College of Science.

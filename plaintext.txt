There were only two ways to get out of this mess if they all worked together. The problem was that neither was all that appealing. 
One would likely cause everyone a huge amount of physical pain while the other would likely end up with everyone in jail. 
In Sam's mind, there was only one thing to do. 
He threw everyone else under the bus and he secretly sprinted away leaving the others to take the fall without him.

There was no ring on his finger.
  - That was a good sign although far from proof that he was available.
  - Still, it was much better than if he had been wearing a wedding ring on his hand. 
  - She glanced at his hand a bit more intently to see if there were any tan lines where a ring may have been. 
  
He's simply taken it off. She couldn't detect any which was also a good sign and a relief. 
The next step would be to get access to his wallet to see if there were any family photos in it.
It wasn't that he hated her. It was simply that he didn't like her much. 
It was difficult for him to explain this to her, and even more difficult for her to truly understand. 
She was in love and wanted him to feel the same way. He didn't, and no matter how he tried to explain to her she refused to listen or to understand.

**OVERVIEW :** A cipher tool that can encrypt and decrypt messages. It uses the RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman) Algorithim to generate public and private keys needed to encrypt and decrypt. This is a 1st year capstone project for Computer Programming 2.

**MAIN CHALLENGE :** Reinventing the wheel by creating our own number precision library, as external libraries are not allowed. `You can checkout the progress of the library at ./src/bignum.h!`
